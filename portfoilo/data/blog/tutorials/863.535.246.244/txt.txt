Use Custom Themes iltersinavv 21 April 2021 Â· 1-6 minute read Using custom themes in GitHub Pages is not very hard, but it requires a bit of your time. 1st, be sure that you have your repository. 2nd, Go to "startbootstrap.com/themes" and install a theme as a .zip file. Next, go back to your repository, and press "Setup in Desktop". After that, open GitHub Desktop. If you don't have it, install it. 5th, edit the content using any text editor can open code. I recommend Visual Studio or Notepad++. When you're done, go back to GitHub Desktop and hit "Open on Explorer" and paste the content in the .zip file of the theme you installed. Then, choose a name and a despriction (optional) and commit your file, when you're done, push it. Next, refresh the project page on GitHub Web. Go to Settings > Pages. Change "None" to "main" then press save. Done!
